The other results are from different job boards, but they mention LangChain and AI Engineer roles. However, the user specifically asked for LinkedIn. Since I can't find LinkedIn links, maybe I should inform them that direct LinkedIn postings aren't available and provide the closest matches from other platforms. But the user's instructions require using the JSON schema with URLs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's output schema requires an array of sources with URLs. So even if the sources aren't LinkedIn, as long as they are valid job postings mentioning the criteria, maybe that's acceptable. But the user specified LinkedIn. Since I can't find LinkedIn links, perhaps I need to state that and list the available ones. However, the final answer must conform to the schema, which requires an 'answer' and 'sources' array with URLs. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the answer should mention that no LinkedIn postings were found and provide the closest matches from other job boards. The sources would include the URLs from Indeed, ZipRecruiter, etc. But the user asked for LinkedIn. Alternatively, maybe the LangChain careers page is a valid source since it's a company's own job postings. Let me check the fourth result again. The URL is https://www.langchain.com/careers, and the content mentions open roles in San Francisco. That's a valid source. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I can list that as one source. The other two could be from the Indeed and ZipRecruiter links, even though they are job boards. The user might not mind if the tools can't access LinkedIn. So compiling three sources: LangChain's careers page, the Indeed job search for San Mateo, CA, and the ZipRecruiter job search in San Francisco. Even though they are not LinkedIn, they are valid job postings related to the query. The answer should note that LinkedIn-specific postings weren't found but provide these alternatives.\n",
